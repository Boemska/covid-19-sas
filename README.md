# COVID-19 Epidemiological Scenario and Critical Resource Utilization Prediction Program

This is a collaboration space for SAS and others to understand, model, and mitigate COVID-19 through analytics. The projects here include:

* [SIR & SEIR Modeling (with Cleveland Clinic)](#sir--seir-modeling-with-cleveland-clinic)
* [Data sources for COVID-19 reporting](#data-sources-for-covid-19-reporting)

To use the work in these projects, a SAS environment is required.  Refer to the documentation for each project to learn more about the SAS system requirements.

## SIR & SEIR Modeling (with Cleveland Clinic)

This first entry is a collaboration between the Cleveland Clinic and SAS Institute. Explore [the /CCF folder](./CCF)
for code and documentation about the model implementation.

### How to experience this project and learn more

Experts from Cleveland Clinic and SAS will present about this project and its impact during SAS Global Forum (virtual, online) on June 16, 2020.  [Visit the event site to register](https://www.sas.com/en_us/events/sas-global-forum/agenda.html) or to view the on-demand presentation after the event.

This project is also the engine for an [interactive visual interface that is hosted by SAS](https://www.sas.com/en_us/trials/software/epidemiological-scenario-analysis/form.html), available now.  The web-based interface does not require a local SAS environment.

### Outputs from sample scenarios

Among other outputs, these analyses will create diagnostic visuals for each modeled scenario.

## Data sources for COVID-19 reporting

SAS developers and data scientists maintain a [Coronavirus Dashboard Report](https://www.sas.com/covid19) using SAS Visual Analytics.
The dashboard is refreshed daily with new data from several public data sources.  [In the /Data folder](./Data), the team has shared
the SAS programs that are used to retrieve and prepare this data for reporting.
